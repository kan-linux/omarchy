# Networking

Networking in Omarchy is handled by NetworkManager, and you drive it from the network icon in the [top bar](05-the-top-bar.md) or with `Super + Ctrl + W`.

That panel scans for Wi-Fi networks, shows signal strength, and connects. Ethernet needs nothing at all — plug it in and it works. If you'd rather stay in the terminal, `nmtui` gives you the same controls, and there's an `omarchy network` command group too.

## Sharing your Wi-Fi

If you need the password for the network you're on, `omarchy network password <interface>` prints it.

## DNS

Omarchy uses whatever DNS your network hands out over DHCP. You can override that for the whole machine under _Setup > Network > DNS_, where Cloudflare and Google are one click away. Pick _Custom_ to type in your own servers.

From the terminal, `omarchy dns` prints the current provider and `omarchy dns Cloudflare` sets one.

## Pinning the Wi-Fi band

If your router puts 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz on the same network name, your laptop will sometimes cling to the slow one. `omarchy network band` shows which band you're on, and `omarchy network band 5` pins it. Use `auto` to let it choose again.

This pins the band rather than a specific access point, so you keep roaming between APs normally.

## How fast is it?

_Trigger > Speed Test > Network Speed Test_ measures your actual up and down speed with a pair of dials. From the terminal it's `omarchy network speedtest down` or `up`. (There's a disk speed test sitting next to it in that menu, if you're benchmarking the other bottleneck.)

## The firewall

The firewall is on by default and blocks all incoming traffic, with one exception: port 53317, so [LocalSend](22-guis.md) works out of the box.

SSH is off until you turn it on with _Setup > Security > SSHD_, which starts the daemon, opens port 22 rate-limited against brute force, and authorizes a key. Docker is locked down too, so containers can't accidentally expose themselves to the world. See [security](48-security.md) for the whole story.

## When it stops working

Before rebooting, try restarting the offending piece on its own. _Update > Hardware_ has Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Audio, and Trackpad, and reloading one of those clears up most "it worked five minutes ago" situations. See [troubleshooting](45-troubleshooting.md).
